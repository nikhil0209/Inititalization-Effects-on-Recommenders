# Inititalization-Effects-on-Recommenders
Given a bipartite sets (say users and movies), working on finding alternatives to stochastic gradient descent to learn vector (or alternate space) embeddings to arrive at a “better” embeddings that can be used directly or as initialization to SGD which are more representative and informative
